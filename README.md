# Agent-Based Modelling Project

## Workflow

1. **Branch Management**
   - **Create a Branch:** Always create your own branch from `master` before starting any work.
   - **Branch Naming:** Use descriptive names (e.g., `feature/add-model` or use your name if you prefer sticking to one working branch).

2. **Notebooks**
   - **Clear Output Results:** Always clear output results before committing Jupyter notebooks to avoid conflicts.
     - In Jupyter: `Kernel` > `Restart & Clear Output`.

3. **Merging to Master**
   - **Test Thoroughly:** Ensure code is tested and works properly before merging.
   - **Purposeful Commits:** Only commit code that will be used in the project.
   - **Code Review:** Consider having your code reviewed before merging (optional).

4. **Keeping Your Branch Up to Date**
   - **Daily Pulls:** Pull the latest changes from `master` daily to avoid large number of conflicts to resolve.
     - Command: `git pull origin master`.
